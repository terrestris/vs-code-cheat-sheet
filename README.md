## VS Code Cheat Sheet

### How to add a shortcut ❓

In the current state this Cheat-Sheet is not connected to any database.
But you can add shortcuts or extensions anyways.

Just add your shortcut or extension in the corresonding file in the `public` folder.

❗Hint: You can copy the vsCodeKey with right click in your settings overview.

Later on we might have a UI and a database to store this properly.
